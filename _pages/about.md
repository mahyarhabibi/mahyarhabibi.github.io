I am a PhD student in Economics at Bocconi University in Milan. I'm visiting the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto during the Academic Year 2023-2024. My primary areas of interest are in the Economics of Artificial Intelligence, Social Media, Technology, and Innovation. I am interested in applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques in economics and quantitative social science research.
