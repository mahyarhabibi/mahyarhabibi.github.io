I am a  Ph.D. student in Economics at Bocconi University in Milan. My research interests are in applied microeconomics, the economics of artificial intelligence, and innovation. I'm particularly interested in using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to uncover novel patterns and insights from structured and unstructured data.
