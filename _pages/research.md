### [Gender Gaps: A Hollywood Story](https://github.com/mahyarhabibi/GenderGaps_Hollywood/blob/main/GenderGaps_Hollywood_20220823.pdf)
__Abstract__ \
Using rich data on mainstream movies released between 1990-2021, I study gender gaps in the film industry, focusing on the outcomes of female-directed movies. First, I analyze gender gaps in budgets, sales, and professional and non-professional critical reviews. To account for differences between male and female-directed movies, I construct a high-dimensional space of observable characteristics by using movies' detailed attributes and performing Latent Semantic Analysis on movie plots. The results uncover large and significant gender gaps in budgets and sales between male and female-directed movies which is not explained by observable differences. Then, I explore the impact of the \#MeToo movement and find that critics started to review female-directed movies more favorably after this movement started. However, neither non-professional reviews nor other outcomes seem to have been affected. Finally, I propose a novel machine learning procedure to estimate critics' personal preferences and explore gender-based favoritism among critics at the individual level. I discover evidence of favoritism for only 3.5\%  of critics.
