### [Gender Gaps: A Hollywood Story](https://mahyarhabibi.github.io/GenderGaps_Hollywood/GenderGaps_Hollywood_20220823.pdf)
__Abstract__:
Using rich data on mainstream movies released between 1990-2021, I study gender gaps in the film industry, focusing on the outcomes of female-directed movies. First, I analyze gender gaps in budgets, sales, and professional and non-professional critical reviews. To account for differences between male and female-directed movies, I construct a high-dimensional space of observable characteristics by using movies' detailed attributes and performing Latent Semantic Analysis on movie plots. The results uncover large and significant gender gaps in budgets and sales between male and female-directed movies which is not explained by observable differences. Then, I explore the impact of the \#MeToo movement and find that critics started to review female-directed movies more favorably after this movement started. However, neither non-professional reviews nor other outcomes seem to have been affected. Finally, I propose a novel machine learning procedure to estimate critics' personal preferences and explore gender-based favoritism among critics at the individual level. I discover evidence of favoritism for only 3.5\%  of critics.

### [Closing the Gap: Consequences of Almost Free Health Insurance on Healthcare Utilization and Infant Mortality in Iran.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Plt5IDuel9ZmX93BjxcZJoDQ7z9Sd8g/view?usp=sharing)
(With Mohammad Vesal and Farshad Fatemi) \
__Abstract__:
 In 2014, the Iranian government introduced Salamat Universal Insurance Program (SUIP), which offered almost free primary health insurance to every uninsured individual. Consequently, more than ten million individuals were given primary insurance by SUIP, and primary health insurance coverage rose by nearly 15 percentage points among the urban population. We assess the impact of SUIP on healthcare utilization and mortality of various age groups among the urban population. The results indicate that the introduction of SUIP has effectively improved outpatient healthcare utilization and reduced infant mortality. However, no discernible impact is found on the utilization of inpatient services and mortality of other age groups. We attribute these findings to the insufficient coverage of primary insurance in the inpatient sector and the extremeness of mortality as a health indicator for these age groups.

### Has AI Adoption Stimulated Innovation?
__Summary__:
Despite a large number of theories and speculations about the prospective impact of Artificial Intelligence on innovation in the economy, empirical evidence on this subject is extremely rare. In this study, I exploit an exogenous shock that affected firms' access to AI skills to explore the impact of AI adoption on innovation in firms.
